## Getting Started

### Project Setup

Start by creating a new `vite` project.

```bash
npm create vite
```

You'll be prompted to name your project and select a project type.  Name your project and then select `Vanilla` as the project type.  Choose `TypeScript` as your project language.

#### Running the project

Starting the project by following the instructions you're presented with:

```bash
  cd vite-project
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

where `vite-project` is whatever you named your project.

The `npm run dev` command starts the project.  If you press `o`, your browser will open to your project, hosted locally on your machine.  If you press `q`, the project will close.uit
